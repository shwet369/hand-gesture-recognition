## Hand Gesture Recognition Using MediaPipe
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It utilizes computer vision to detect and interpret hand gestures captured from a webcam, making it suitable for applications like sign language translation, gesture-controlled interfaces, and interactive systems.

Key Features:
- Detects hand landmarks in real-time.
- Recognizes 5 fingers (thumb to pinky) for simple gesture-based control.
- Provides flexibility for custom gestures and use cases.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git
   cd hand-gesture-recognition
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python hand_gesture_recognition.py
   ```

#### Usage
Provide an example of how to use the code and the expected output.

## Usage

- Ensure you have a working webcam connected to your device.
- Run the script and watch the real-time gesture detection. The program will display the hand landmarks and indicate whether each finger is up or down based on the handâ€™s position.

- Press `x` to exit the program.
